### Proposed business questions for initial exploratory data analysis
1. How has the no-show rate been behaving over the last 6 months?
    1. Throughout the entire company?
    2. Per location?
    3. Per medical specialty?
    4. Per month?
2. What is the cost associated to the no-show problem?
3. What is the distribution of medical specialities per clinic?
4. How many doctors per clinic?
5. Find out statistics regarding age, income, sex, demographic, locations for patients at each clinic.

### Proposed guidelines to collaborate
- When working on an issue, create a new branch named "i{n}", where 'n' refers to the issue number. For example, if you wanted to start working on issue #54, you would create a branch named "i54" to work on it.
- To link a pull request to an issue, use the keywords described in [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
