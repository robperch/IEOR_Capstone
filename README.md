### Proposed business questions for initial exploratory data analysis
1. How has the no-show rate been behaving over the last 6 months?
    1. Throughout the entire company?
    2. Per location?
    3. Per medical specialty?
    4. Per month?
2. What is the cost associated to the no-show problem?

### Proposed guidelines to collaborate
- When working on an issue, create a new branch named "i{n}", where 'n' refers to the issue number. For example, if you wanted to start working on issue #54, you would create a branch named "i54" to work on it.
